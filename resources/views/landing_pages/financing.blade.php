                    <p>Ayude has consciously opted for the place financing formula (and therefore not for individual financial adoption or sponsorships). In this way the sponsor/donor finances and supports a place for a child in a specific project. After all, we would like every child from the projects to be treated in the same way. Moreover, if a specific child disappears from a project, for example due to the relocation of the parents or guardian, the place of this child is immediately filled by one of the many children on our waiting lists.</p>

                            <p id="more3" style="display: none;"> Furthermore, the children are taught the most important values ​​of life through regular activities and organization of events (often on Saturdays) comparable to the youth movements of ours (Scouts, Chiro etc.). On these occasions the children and teenagers are taught interact responsibly and how they can contribute to the development of their communities.

                            Furthermore, there is also education in English for the low-skilled parents, tutoring for the children, education in hygiene and food safety regulations, cut and seam courses, dance and song.

                    <h3>3. Emergency Aid and Reconstruction <button onclick="myFunction()" id="myBtn" class="btn btn-primary">Read more</button></h3>

                    <p>Ayude also occasionally provides assistance with natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes. The first priority in these cases is to provide the affected areas with potable water and food. At a later stage, help is also given in the reconstruction of the houses, schools, etc.<span id="dots">...</span>
                    <p id="more" style="display: none;">Fathers of children from the programs, otherwise partially or completely unemployed without benefits, actively participate in the construction of “houses” and the construction of streets. Numerous testimonies of responsible parenting, restored marriages and reunited families have been reaching us for many years, with the result very often community gatherings and parent associations.</p></p>

                    <h3>4. Supporting the often inferior position of women in certain societies <button onclick="myFunction2()" id="myBtn2" class="btn btn-primary">Read more</button></h3>

                    <p>In addition to the professional care providers, it is not uncommon for the mothers who, as “first-line volunteers”, actively participate in the implementation of the programs and the guidance of the children and their families.
                    <span id="dots2">...</span>
                    <p id="more2" style="display: none;"> They prepare meals, help with medical assignments, receive and teach in food safety, hygiene and family planning (according to the so-called “train the trainer” principle) and often act as project coordinators.
                    India we have set up an education project especially for girls because in this country they are still not treated equally in terms of education in many of the cases.</p></p>
