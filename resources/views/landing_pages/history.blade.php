                    <p>
                        After a visit to the Philippines, Charles Verberckmoes was moved by seeing the conditions in which the children of Manila (the capital) live in the slums. Together with a few friends (now the administrators) he founded an organization aimed at improving the economic, social and mental condition of poor (street) children.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        We soon came into contact with a local Filipino aid organization (led by Steve Mirpuri) who shared the same vision as Ayude. Thus Ayude for a New Day (the Spanish word for Help Mee! For a new day) was founded as a non-profit organization in 1994.
